Description: This package is a motley of functions for data management (no
    statistical analysis) that could come in handy on a regular basis (or at
    least they did in the past). If you're lazy when it comes to
    copying/pasting between projects or reinventing the wheel but not so much
    when it comes to testing new functions and improving them, this package
    might be for you.
